                <p>Food waste is a global issue that has far-reaching consequences. It strains our environment,
                   depletes natural resources, and contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, while millions of 
                   people around the world still suffer from hunger. Our team seeks to address this complex 
                   problem by creating this website that focuses on minimizing food waste in a sustainable 
                   manner.Food waste is a pressing issue that contributes significantly to environmental degradation. 
                   It not only represents a waste of resources used in production, but also leads to unnecessary 
                   greenhouse gas emissions. Our team aims to address this issue by proposing a sustainable 
                   approach to minimize food waste.</p><br><br>

                    <p>Food waste is a major contributor to food shortage and environmental problems. 
                        According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, about 
                        one-third of the food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted globally. 
                        This amounts to about 1.3 billion tonnes of food per year. Reducing food waste can 
                        save money, resources, and emissions, and help feed more people in need.</p>

                <h5>here are some sustainable approaches to manage food shortages:</h5><br><br>               
                <ul><li><p>Shift to Healthier, More Sustainable Diets: Limiting ruminant meat 
                    consumption to 52 calories per person per day by 2050—about 1.5 
                    burgers per week—would reduce the GHG mitigation gap by half and nearly 
                    close the land.</p></li><br>
                <li><p>Increase Local Food Production: This can be achieved by increasing 
                        research and development in agriculture, adopting precision 
                        agriculture with better pesticides and fertiliser management 
                        (and drone technology), and adopting climate-smart agriculture 
                        with higher-yield crops that use less water</p></li><br>
                <li><p>Increase Food Production Without Expanding Agricultural Land: 
                   This can be achieved by improving the unit efficiency of food production</p></li><br>
                <li><p>Buy Only What You Need: Make a list and stick to it</p></li><br>
                <li><p>Understand Dates: Learn the difference between “sell by,” “use by,” and “best before” dates</p></li></ul><br><br>

        <P class="pp">According to the World Bank, domestic food price inflation remains high, with inflation higher than 5% experienced 
           in 57.1% of low-income countries, 83% of lower-middle-income countries, and 59% of upper-middle-income countries, 
           with many experiencing double-digit inflation1. The most-affected countries are in Africa, North America, Latin America, 
           South Asia, Europe, and Central Asia1. In real terms, food price inflation exceeded overall inflation in 77% of the 
           170 countries1. The International Food Policy Research Institute highlighted the 2023 World Food Day theme of “Water 
           is Life, Water is Food. Leave No One Behind,” which underscores the often-underestimated role of water in food systems1.
           A new FAO report found that global agricultural losses due to natural disasters amounted to $3.8 trillion from 1991 to
           2021—equivalent to annual losses of $123 billion, or about 5 percent of global agricultural gross domestic product 
           (GDP)1. It is likely that this is an underestimate of the true amount of damage, because it focuses on crops and 
           livestock. Lack of data prevented comprehensive analysis of damage to forestry, fisheries, and aquaculture1. Despite 
           that, estimated losses over the past 31 years could have met the daily dietary requirements of 400 million to 500 
           million people1. UN reports suggest that around 2.3 billion people in the world (29.3%) were moderately or severely 
           food insecure in 2021 - 350 million more compared to before the outbreak of the COVID‑19 pandemic. Nearly 924 million 
           people (11.7% of the global population) faced food insecurity at severe levels, an increase of 207 million in two years2.</P>
